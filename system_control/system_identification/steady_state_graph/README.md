the controll is achieved with one powerfull MOSFET that controls the voltage trough the heater


the reading of the temperature is achieved by reading the voltage drop over a termistor connected in a voltage delitel 
the known resistances are discretisized in 3 sectors:
32.5 kOhm
2.5 kOhm
150 Ohm

(they were calculated using the matlab files in the upper folder)
the swap between the reading ranges is done by using MOSFETS to control if a specific resistor is connecred or not
